        <p><strong>Behind the Analysis: The Making of The Economics of Wartime Trading</strong>
        
        <p>The project began as a personal research interest rather than a formal assignment. I was fascinated by how wars reshape economic landscapes, and I wanted to explore whether it was possible to model these changes in a way that an everyday investor could understand. My aim was to build something technically rigorous but still accessible, blending economic theory, scraped financial data, and historical analysis into a single framework.</p>

        <p>The first phase of the project was highly exploratory. I started by identifying the sectors that consistently shift during wartime; energy, defense, food systems, and cybersecurity. To ground my work, I turned to real-world data from government sources, company earnings, and industry reports. Much of this information wasn’t neatly packaged, so I used Python-based data scraping techniques to pull prices, company performance, and defense budget figures into workable datasets. Version 1 became a proof-of-concept: a paper rooted in optimization models that illustrated how volatility spikes and capital reallocates during conflict. It was math-heavy and theory-driven, but it gave me a foundation to work from.</p>

        <p>After reviewing that first version, I realized the analysis needed more context and depth. That’s what shaped phase two. Instead of talking about “defense” or “energy” in broad terms, I focused on specific companies like ExxonMobil, Cheniere Energy, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. This shift grounded the paper in reality, tying abstract models to actual businesses whose performance reflected wartime dynamics. I also layered in historical parallels, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, to show how these patterns repeat themselves across conflicts. The second version transformed the project from a technical sketch into a more comprehensive, research-backed essay.</p>

        <p>The final version pulled everything together into a cohesive narrative. It combined rigorous financial modeling with company-level case studies and historical perspective, while also acknowledging the moral and human context behind wartime investing. This balance between technical analysis and broader storytelling was key. I wanted the project to not only demonstrate data-driven insights but also to highlight the complex realities that lie behind market behavior during conflict.</p>

        <p>Looking back, this project taught me how to take a curiosity-driven idea and develop it into a structured piece of research. The process involved scraping and cleaning messy datasets, cross-referencing multiple sources, and iterating until the work felt both technically sound and narratively compelling. Most importantly, it reinforced the value of self-directed exploration—by following my own interests and pushing myself through multiple versions, I was able to create something that reflects both my technical skills and my ability to connect economic theory to real-world events.</p>
