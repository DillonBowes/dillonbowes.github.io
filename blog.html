          Building a Personal Website from Scratch

        <div class="blog-post-content">
          <p>
            Creating this website has been an exciting project, and Iâ€™m proud to
            say that everything you see here is my own work. I designed and
            coded the entire site from scratch, from the dark-themed layout and
            navigation bar to the background images and interactive elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every visual element, including the custom backgrounds, text boxes,
            and project sections, were created by me. I also wrote all the HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript that powers the blog, project pages, and
            interactive features.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project has been a great way to combine design, coding, and
            creative expression into a single platform that represents my work
            and interests.
